# Computer-Science-Projects

This repository features my work from CS111 Intro to Computer Science (Python), CS201 Data Structures (Java), both of which I took
in the 2015-2016 academic year at Carleton College. CS111 was taken with Professor Anna Rafferty, while CS201 was taken
with Professor Andy Exley. Both courses involve a comprehensive final project, which well demonstrates the majority
of skills learnt throughout the courses. A grade of 'A', highest attainable grade, was achieved in both courses.

For demonstration sake, I have avoided depositing zip files where possible. Hence, some python files may not work
as supporting images and supporting modules may not be included; the files contained are purely works that I have created.
All java projects are deposited in zip files, as the nature of java stipulates many inter-related modules to be 
documented together.
